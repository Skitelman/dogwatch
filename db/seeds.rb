# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# user1 = User.new(first_name: "", last_name: "", email: "", address1: "", address2: "", city: "", state: "", zipcode: "")
# pet1 = Pet.new(name: "", description: "")

# user1.pets << pet1

# Request.new(start: DateTime.now, end: )
